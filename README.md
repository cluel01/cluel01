## Selected Projects

### [Decision Branches](https://github.com/decisionbranches/decisionbranches)
A novel machine learning model for efficient search. This project presents a framework for search-by-classification scenarios that allows users to interactively search for target objects using a small set of positive and negative examples. The framework transforms the inference phase into a set of range queries, efficiently executed by leveraging multidimensional indexing structures.

### [RapidEarth](https://github.com/decisionbranches/rapidearth)
A geospatial search engine designed to rapidly search for interesting objects in very large collections of satellite imagery. RapidEarth integrates multidimensional indexing structures with decision branches, allowing for efficient processing of search queries without scanning the entire data catalog. (Submitted via my anonymous account for review purposes)

### [CLIP-Branches](https://github.com/cluel01/clip-branches)
An interactive text-image search engine built upon the CLIP architecture. CLIP-Branches enhances traditional text-image search by incorporating an interactive fine-tuning phase, allowing users to iteratively define positive and negative examples to improve search relevance and accuracy.

### [Py-KDtree](https://github.com/cluel01/py_kdtree)
A highly efficient Python library for k-d trees using Cython. This library implements the compute-intensive parts of the data structure in Cython, providing significant performance improvements over pure Python implementations. k-d trees are used for organizing points in k-dimensional space and are commonly employed in nearest neighbor search applications.

### [SA Segmentation](https://github.com/cluel01/SA_semantic_segmentation)
A deep learning project for the detection of trees in South Africa. Utilizing high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning models, this project maps individual trees and shrubs across South Africa, contributing to ecological research and policy formulation for climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation.
